Note Stack is a backend service built with **TypeScript, Express, and MongoDB** that provides a clean and scalable Notes CRUD API.  
It currently supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes without authentication or user ownership.  
The project focuses on correct REST design, strict schema validation, and production-ready structure.  
Notes are globally accessible in this initial implementation.  
Future updates will introduce authentication, user-specific notes, and real-time collaboration.
